## Brastlewark
This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome town called
Brastlewark. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to
browse all the inhabitants details. We've found a server providing all the census data
of Brastlewark at the following address:

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do.
That's the reason they can have more than one job and might have few or even no
friends at all. They also appreciate their privacy so they've used some random
images from internet, not specifically optimized for mobile devices, for their profile.
(They are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to
internet for instance).

## Specifications:
- Retrieve data from the URL provided
- Show this data in the most user-friendly way you could think. Keep in mind our heroes will be quite busy dealing with Orcs, so apps have to be really simple and easy to use. At least would be good to quickly browse (and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.
- Document all libraries used and explain the reason youâ€™ve used that library.
- Test the app: add the most important test you think it is needed.

## Bonus:
- Be creative!
- UI must not blocked by network connections or long operations 
- Images coming from network cached to improve performance
- Error handling
- Avoid using third party libraries for basic functionality (we want to see you know the basics!)
- Use third party libraries for extended functionality
- Snappiness & responsiveness over sluggishness & idleness
- Determine gender of gnomes (just joking on this one but feel free to make your guess)
- Test the app
